# Brief Description:    
This directory contains the following files:    
- `Assignment 2.pdf`: Description of problem statement  
- `Train_B.csv`: Contains the data used for training the Naive-Bayes Classifier  
- `data_processor.py`: Contains the helper functions related to the processing of the data  
- `main.py`: Contains the solution to problems provided in the `Assignment 2.pdf`    
- `model.py`: Contains all the necessary functions and implementation of Naive-Bayes Algorithm for Classification problems       
- `requirements.txt`: Contains all the necessary dependencies and their versions   
- `simulation.txt`: Sample simulation output on entire data (it is advisable to train on a subset of input data to obtain results in less time)
- `utils.py`: Contains all the helper functions used by the above files (if any)  
- `variance_ratio_cumulative_sum.png`: The plot of variance ratio cumulative sum **vs** number of princial components  
- `variance_ratio_PCA.png`: The plot of proportion of variance explained **vs** Principal Component  

# Directions to use the code  
1. Download this directory into your local machine

2. Copy the file `Train_B.csv` to the directory where the code resides

3. Ensure all the necessary dependencies with required version and latest version of Python3 are available (verify with `requirements.txt`)  <br>
 `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

4. Run specific functions with the aid of `main.py` <br>

# For giving the input fraction ( the fraction of dataset to be used for the model )
- Using the default full dataset <br>
`python3 main.py`

- Giving input fraction (say 0.1, that is 10% of the dataset randomly chosen) -- fraction should be between 0 and 1 <br>
`python3 main.py --frac 0.1`

- For more help regarding the arguments <br>
`python3 frac.py --help`

# For giving the input outlier threshhold 
- If the number of outliers in a data is more than threshold then the data will be dropped<br>

- Using the default threshold<br>
`python3 main.py`

- Default threshold is the maximum value of the outlier in the dataset ( that is 3 for the given dataset )

- Giving input outlier threshold (say 2, that is data points having number of outliers greater than or equal 2 will be dropped) -- outlier should be positive integer (>0) <br>
`python3 main.py --outlier 2`

- For more help regarding the arguments <br>
`python3 frac.py --help`
