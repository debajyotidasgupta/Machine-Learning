# Brief Description:    
This directory contains the following files:    
- `Assignment 2.pdf`: Description of problem statement  
- `Train_B.csv`: Contains the data used for training the Naive-Bayes Classifier  
- `data_processor.py`: Contains the helper functions related to the processing of the data  
- `main.py`: Contains the solution to problems provided in the `Assignment 2.pdf`    
- `model.py`: Contains all the necessary functions and implementation of Naive-Bayes Algorithm for Classification problems       
- `requirements.txt`: Contains all the necessary dependencies and their versions   
- `simulation.txt`: Sample simulation output on entire data (it is advisable to train on a subset of input data to obtain results in less time)
- `utils.py`: Contains all the helper functions used by the above files (if any)  
- `variance_ratio_cumulative_sum.png`: The plot of variance ratio cumulative sum **vs** number of princial components
